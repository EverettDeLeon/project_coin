Goal: 
Write a program that can tell you the potential of long term investment.

What is it:
I believe you could use crypto currencies, with such large short term 
gains to speed up the process of compound interest. Treat weeks as years
and your monthly investment as the capital to grown on. A consistent 
investment combined with a minimum 10% growth per week, which is 
a pretty conservative growth rate for a currency with potential. 
Creates an environment where your money will soon build up extremely 
fast.


Logic: every week you have adds the growth percentage to the current
balance. Every 4 weeks (a month) your routine investment also gets added
to the current balance. 


Unfinished stuff:
Pull data from coinbase
Drop down menu to know what to pull from coinbase
Include all market data
Use market data to calculate probabilities based on market cap and potential growth
